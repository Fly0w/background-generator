## History

That background generator is one project from the Zero-to-Mastery Web Developer course, meant to teach the students how to perform DOM manipulation with Javascript and CSS. I have customized it with an orientation parameter, as well as a color randomizer.

## Features

- 2 colors gradient generator with color selectors
- Linear Gradient Orientation selector
- Color Randomizer
- Copy-pastable linear gradient CSS property 

## What next ?

The next step is to add other types of color gradient (circular gradient...)
